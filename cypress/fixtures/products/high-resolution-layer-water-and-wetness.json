In this context, frequently updated reliable data about water and wet surfaces in Europe is necessary for efficient water management. Specifically, with the more frequent and higher quality Earth observation data of the Sentinel satellites this information can be provided even in a higher spatial resolution of 10 m for the 2018 reference year as compared to 2015 (20 m spatial resolution). Higher resolution of the input data and additional layers improve the information quality and quantity to feed the increasing reporting obligations of European Union organisations as well as Member States."
